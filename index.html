			<p>As a Lead Software Engineer with over 17 years of experience in IT development and services, I specialize in designing and delivering high-quality, scalable software solutions. My expertise spans across a broad range of technologies, including Java, Spring, Spring Boot/Cloud, React JS, and cloud infrastructure (AWS and private cloud). I am adept at leveraging SDLC best practices, REST and microservices architecture, containerization, and IntelliJ plugins to drive software excellence.

				Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve successfully managed medium to large teams across local and global regions, fostering a collaborative environment where innovation and efficiency thrive. I bring strong project management skills, an ability to set and achieve strategic goals, and an adaptive approach to both Agile/Scrum and Waterfall methodologies.
				
				In addition to my technical acumen, I am passionate about mentoring and empowering my team members to reach their full potential. I thrive in dynamic environments and am always eager to tackle new challenges, particularly in cybersecurity and data-centric projects.
				
				Currently pursuing an MS in Data Science, I am excited to further enhance my skills in data-driven decision-making and advanced analytics. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate!
